#### **Supports**:
 - Reader supports .xlsx and .xlsm file extensions.
 - Writer only supports .xlsx (no macros/buttons/graphs/formatting) 

#### **Limitations**:
 - Does not support .xls (excel 97-2003 worksheet).
 - Does not support worksheet cell data more than 536,870,912 cells (32-bit list limitation).
 - Writer does not support anything other than writing values/formulas/strings.
 - Writing to existing workbooks will remove any macros/buttons/graphs/formatting!

---

#### **Why pylightxl over pandas/openpyxl/xlrd**

- **Zero non-standard library dependencies** 
  No compatibility/version control issues.

- **Light-weight single source code file that supports both Python3 and Python2.7.18.** 
  Single source file that can easily be copied directly into a project for true zero-dependency. 
  Great for those that have installation/download restrictions. 
  In addition the library's size and zero dependency makes this library pyinstaller compilation small and easy!

- **100% test-driven development for highest reliability/maintainability with 100% coverage on all supported versions**

- **API aimed to be user friendly and intuitive. Structure: database > worksheet > indexing example:**
   ``db.ws('Sheet1').index(row=1,col=2)``  or ``db.ws('Sheet1').address(address='B1')``

---

#### **Setup**
pylightxl is officially published on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org), however one of the
key features of pylightxl is that it is packed light in case the user has pip
and/or download restrictions, see [docs - installation](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

```pip install pylightxl```

#### **pypi version 1.51**
